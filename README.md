# OSRI Website Redesign – Accessibility & Digital Transformation

## Goal / Objective
This repository documents the end-to-end process of leading a full-scale redesign and relaunch of the Office of Student Research and Innovation (OSRI) website at California State University, San Bernardino. The project was initiated to address hard-to-navigate site into a modern, student-centered digital hub that supports research and innovation across all academic disciplines.

## Key Objectives
- Simplify Navigation: Reorganize information architecture to reduce user friction and support calls.
- Ensure WCAG Compliance: Replace all image-based text and implement a fully accessible, screen-reader-friendly layout.
- Improve Content Discovery: Surface high-demand resources (funding, events, forms) through visual tiles and a "Quick Links" panel.
- Reflect Interdisciplinary Mission: Update branding, imagery, and language to be inclusive of all fields (Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences), not just STEM.
- Strengthen Institutional Alignment: Ensure the redesign adhered to CSUSB's branding guidelines and digital transformation roadmap.
 
## Role & Skills Demonstrated
I owned this project from conception to launch, wearing multiple hats and leveraging a diverse skill set:
- Project Management: Scoped, scheduled, and delivered a multi-team project under deadline using agile-inspired methods.
- Stakeholder Communication: Translated technical and design concepts into clear, persuasive narratives for non-technical leaders.
- Storytelling Through Design: Created compelling Figma mockups and structured proposals to align stakeholders and secure buy-in at every stage.
- Cross-Functional Collaboration: Facilitated alignment between technical (ITS), creative (VRC), and administrative (OSRI) teams to ensure cohesive execution.
- Problem-Solving: Pivoted gracefully around content delays and permission dependencies without impacting timeline.
- UX & Analytics: Balanced user needs, branding guidelines, and technical feasibility into a cohesive, impactful design.

## Impact and Result
- Simplified navigation and improved UI/UX for users (students and faculty) 
- Strengthened OSRI’s digital presence ahead of Fall 2025 launch
- Eliminated all critical accessibility violations
- Increased engagement on the website by 63%
- Positioned OSRI as a more inclusive, research-forward hub on campus
